  Policy-driven PII/secrets scrubber that sits in front of every LLM call and every log write.
</p>

---

LLM applications have **two** data-governance surfaces: what goes *to* the model, and what gets
*written down about* the interaction (logs, traces, vector stores). Privy scans both directions,
applies a per-destination policy, and writes an audit trail that lets a reviewer answer
"why was this SSN allowed through?" from the log alone.

Privy does **not** reinvent detection. It wraps [Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio)
(PII, spaCy NER) and [detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets) (credentials),
and adds the parts those tools don't provide: the policy engine, bidirectional middleware,
audit log, and an evaluation harness that proves the numbers.

## Quick start

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
uv run python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg   # NER model (~600 MB)
export PRIVY_HASH_SECRET=...                      # key for deterministic hash tokens
uv run pytest
```

```python
import privy

guard = privy.Guard.from_policy("policies/default.yaml", audit_db="audit.db")
guard.warm_up()  # loads spaCy once (~4 s)

# 1. Wrap an LLM call — inputs scrubbed before the provider sees them, outputs after.
@privy.redacted_call(guard, adapter=privy.ChatMessagesAdapter())
def chat(*, messages):
    return client.chat.completions.create(model="gpt-4o", messages=messages)

# 2. Or call the surfaces directly.
with guard.session(request_id="req-42") as g:
    prompt = g.inbound("Hi, I'm Maria Gonzalez, card 4111 1111 1111 1111")
    # -> raises privy.BlockedError: blocked at destination 'model': CREDIT_CARD (rule entities.CREDIT_CARD ...)

    line = g.for_logs("user Maria Gonzalez (maria@example.com) asked about billing")
    # -> "user <PERSON:9f3a1c…> (<EMAIL_ADDRESS:b07e…>) asked about billing"

# 3. Every log line, automatically.
import logging
logging.getLogger().addFilter(privy.PrivyLogFilter(guard))
```

The same `PERSON` is **allowed** on the way to the model (the assistant needs the name),
**hashed** in logs (correlate without storing), and **redacted** in the vector store — one
YAML file decides, and every decision is written to the audit log with the rule that made it.

## How it works

| Surface | Method | On policy `block` |
|---|---|---|
| Prompt → model | `guard.inbound(text)` | raises `BlockedError` |
| Completion → caller | `guard.outbound(text)` | raises `BlockedError` |
| Anything → logs / vector DB | `guard.for_logs(text)` / `for_vector_store(text)` | returns `None`; write is dropped |

Policy (`policies/default.yaml`) maps entity → `redact` / `mask` / `hash` / `block` / `allow`
with a per-entity confidence threshold, and lets each destination (`model`, `response`,
`logs`, `vector_store`) override any of it. Precedence is specificity-first, so a
destination-wide default can never loosen an entity-specific rule.

The audit log (SQLite) stores one row per guarded call and one per detection — including
detections that were allowed or fell below threshold — with the policy path that decided the
action and an HMAC of the span. Raw values are never stored.

## Evaluation (ship gate)

160 labelled synthetic examples (302 spans, Faker-generated, never real data) and 100 clean
business documents. Reproduce with `uv run python eval/run.py`.

| Entity | P | R | Entity | P | R |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| `US_SSN` | 1.00 | 1.00 | `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `CREDIT_CARD` | 1.00 | 1.00 | `GITHUB_TOKEN` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `EMAIL_ADDRESS` | 1.00 | 1.00 | `STRIPE_ACCESS_KEY` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `PERSON` | 0.99 | 0.97 | `PRIVATE_KEY` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `STREET_ADDRESS` | 1.00 | 0.93 | `JWT` | 1.00 | 1.00 |
| `PHONE_NUMBER` | 1.00 | 0.76 | `SECRET_KEYWORD` | 1.00 | 0.75 |

- **Clean corpus:** 1 % of documents modified at the `model` destination; 35 % at `logs`
  (spaCy tags capitalised nouns like "Deliverables" as `PERSON` at a fixed 0.85, and the
  logs policy hashes `PERSON` — a deliberate, reported trade-off).
- **Latency** (full path, detect + policy + audit, ~74-char inputs): **p50 7.2 ms, p95 9.6 ms**.
- **Demonstrated block:** an outbound completion echoing an SSN is rejected with a
  `BlockedError` naming the rule, and the audit rows show why.
- **Three Presidio gaps found by the eval and closed** with recognizers in `privy.detect.custom`:
  1. Mastercard 2-series BIN range (2221–2720) missing from Presidio's card regex — recall 0.74 → 1.00.
  2. `UK_NHS` is a bare mod-11 checksum that scores 1.0 on some US phone numbers; it was
     *blocking* requests. Excluded from the default detection set (opt-in for UK health data).
  3. No street-address recognizer; addresses were also being mis-tagged `PERSON`. Added one —
     recall 0 → 0.93, `PERSON` precision 0.93 → 0.99.

Weakest category is `PHONE_NUMBER` recall (extensions, some `+1` spacings, unallocated NANP
area codes). The full report, including every miss, lives in `docs/eval/` (local; see below).

## Project layout

```
src/privy/
  detect/       Presidio + detect-secrets adapters, unified Detection schema, custom recognizers
  policy/       YAML schema, rule resolution, redact/mask/hash actions, PolicyEngine
  middleware/   Guard, @redacted_call, call adapters, PrivyLogFilter
  audit/        OperationRecord/DetectionRecord, SQLite + memory sinks
  evaluation/   dataset builder, span metrics, runner, report
policies/       default.yaml, eval-baseline.yaml
eval/           generate.py, run.py  (datasets are generated on demand, not committed)
tests/          147 tests, 97 % coverage; `-m "not slow"` skips the spaCy-loading ones
docs/           ADRs 0001–0008, architecture, policy & audit reference, eval reports  (untracked)
```

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check src tests eval && uv run ruff format --check src tests eval
uv run mypy src            # --strict
uv run pytest --cov=privy  # 80 % floor enforced
```

## Limitations

- English only; spaCy `en_core_web_lg`. Swap in `en_core_web_trf` via `detection.spacy_model`
  for better NER precision at ~5–10× the latency.
- Streaming completions are not scrubbed (spans can straddle chunks).
- detect-secrets confidences are assigned per plugin class, not measured.
